WARNING: [DRC BUFC-1] Input Buffer Connections: Input buffer Pmod_out_0_pin1_iobuf/IBUF has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
WARNING: [DRC BUFC-1] Input Buffer Connections: Input buffer Pmod_out_0_pin4_iobuf/IBUF has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1709] Clock output buffering: PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal Pmod_OLED_i/mig_7series_0/u_Pmod_OLED_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the Pmod_OLED_i/mig_7series_0/u_Pmod_OLED_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of Pmod_OLED_i/mig_7series_0/u_Pmod_OLED_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
